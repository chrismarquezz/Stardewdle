# Stardewdle

Stardewdle is a Wordle-style guessing game based on crops from the popular game Stardew Valley.  
Players have 6 attempts to guess the correct crop based on feedback about 5 key attributes:  
**Growth Time**, **Price**, **Regrowth**, **Crop Type**, and **Season**.

Built with **React** on the frontend and an **AWS-supported** backend, the game compares user guesses against a secret crop and provides color-coded feedback — similar to Wordle but for Stardew Valley!

<br />

## Gameplay Overview

- Guess a crop from Stardew Valley in 6 tries or less.
- After each guess, see feedback:
  - Green: exact match
  - Yellow: partial match
  - Red: incorrect
- Attributes compared include:
  - Growth Time (days)
  - Sell Price (at Normal quality)
  - Regrows (Yes/No)
  - Crop Type (Fruit/Vegetable/Mushroom/Forage/Flower)
  - Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter)
